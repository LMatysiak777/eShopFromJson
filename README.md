# eShopFromJson

Simple eshop build in vanilla JS with Bootstrap and JQuery attached for some visual effects.
Please notice that most of the shop content is generated dynamically from /assets/products.json converted from csv file.
Its more than possible to use different json for custom effect (this will not cover static elements like svg graphics).

Next steps of shop development will be sending email with summary chart after purchase.
Also i want to include CSV- JSON converter and extend CSV template to also cover shop logo and custom messages. 

Any feedback will be invaluable.
